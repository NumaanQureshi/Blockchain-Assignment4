### Contract Purpose
The LostPet smart contract allows pet owners who lost their pet to post a bounty, and reward whoever helps them find their lost pet. 
A pet owner can create a lost pet case, provide description, and send ETH as a bounty. Other users can then submit a found report for that case, providing evidence such as a photo, or location it was found. 
If there is a match and the pet was found, the owner resolves the case by choosing the pet’s finder address. The contract transfers the bounty to that finder and marks that case as resolved.
The contract also allows the owner to increase the bounty in order to motivate help, or to cancel an unresolved case and reclaim their bounty.
